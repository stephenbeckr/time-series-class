# Lecture notes for MATH/STAT 4540/5540 Time Series

I've numbered the notes in the order that we covered them.

Each PDF is not necessarily a single class lecture!  We might cover a few PDFs in lecture (or stop part-way through, and so pickup part-way through next class).

For details on what we covered on what day, see the [lecturesSchedule.md](../lecturesSchedule.md) documenet
