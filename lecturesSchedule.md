# Day-by-day schedule

Spring 2022
#### Week 1
- [Mon, Jan 10]  Logistics, worksheet (prob review, intro to R)
- [Wed, Jan 12]  [Lecture 1](Notes/1_Probability_regression_review.pdf) (probability and regression review) and then [RegressionExample.ipynb](Code/RegressionExample.ipynb): define expectation, variance, covariance, time series, notation. OLS regression. For the code, we went until almost the end (but did not yet cover the overfitting).
- [Fri, Jan 14]  (asynchronous) [Lecture 2](Notes/2_Stationarity_and_Autocorrelation.pdf) and [Lecture 3](Notes/3_Examples_of_stationary_time_series.pdf), defining stationarity, ACF, ACVF, and giving examples MA(1) and AR(1); 1.4 and 2.1 in the book.

#### Week 2
- [Mon, Jan 17] No school (MLK holiday)
- [Wed, Jan 19] [Lecture 4](Notes/4_PropertiesACF_GPs_strict_stationarity.pdf) on ACF properties and Gaussian Processes and strict stationarity. Then we did the [FirstLookAt_AR_and_MA.ipynb](Code/FirstLookAt_AR_and_MA.ipynb) R notebook which showed AR(1) and MA(1) time series, their ACFs, and then had a very fun game on matching time series realizations with sample ACFs
- [Fri, Jan 21] [Lecture 5](Notes/5_SampleEstimators.pdf) on sample estimators for ACF etc (1.4.1 and 2.4); then [Lecture 6](Notes/6_MultivariateNormal.pdf) on the multivariate normal distribution (see appendices A.2 and A.3); then [Lecture 7](Notes/7_EliminatingTrends.pdf) on decomposition models and eliminating trends (1.5.1). We did lecture 7 up to right before Box-Jenkins differencing

#### Week 3 (almost) back in person
- [Mon, Jan 24] (ONLINE STILL; instructor is in isolation)  *plan: section 1.5.2 in book on seasonality*
- [Wed, Jan 26] *plan: ARMA processes, 2.2, 2.3, 3.1*
- [Fri, Jan 28] *plan: ARMA, ch 2 and 3 TBD*

#### Week 4
